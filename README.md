# Project SQL and Data Wrangling Pacmann

## Introduction

This project contains code for analyzing e-commerce sales data of a company called Olist. The data contains information about customer orders, reviews, payments, and more. The aim of the project is to understand sales patterns, customer behavior and delivery

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and folium.

## Data

The data used in this project was obtained from [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y-or_Rba1ambWkkNzhYKtRHRwC7g0A5n) and contains information about e-commerce sales from a Brazilian online retailer Olist.

## Methodology

The data was first cleaned and pre-processed to remove any missing values and ensure the quality of the data. After that, exploratory data analysis was performed to answer several questions about sales patterns, customer behavior, and product reviews. Visualizations were used to better understand and interpret the findings.

## Conclusion

The results of the analysis can be used to make informed decisions and improve the e-commerce sales of the company. The code in this project can also serve as a starting point for further analysis and research.

## How to use

Clone this repository to your local machine and open the Jupyter Notebook file. The code is well documented, and you can run each cell to see the output. Make sure to install all the required libraries before running the code.
